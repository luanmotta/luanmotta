# Hello everyone! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

**Iâ€™m a Full-stack web developer focused on building solutions for real-life problems, most of the time using JavaScript.**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with React & Node.js.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Data Science and AI.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing chess, but it's difficult to casually meet someone in Brazil to play with. If you like chess, let's play a match!

Please take a look at [my portifolio](https://luanmotta.com/) to find more about my experiences and skills.
